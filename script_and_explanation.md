## Script (Voiceover & Captions)
**Hook (0–3s):**  
"Is Joe Root truly one of cricket’s all-time greats? Let’s find out!"

**Highlights (3–50s):**  
- "Root is England’s top batsman and closing in on Sachin Tendulkar’s Test run record."  
- "But against the world’s best bowlers—Cummins, Hazlewood, and Bumrah—he struggles."  
- "Cummins has dismissed Root 13 times at an average of just 22.6, Bumrah 11 times for 30.3, and Hazlewood 10 times."  
- "Most of Root’s big centuries came when these bowlers were absent."  
- "Experts say Root gets trapped by their relentless off-stump line and clever variations, making him look vulnerable."  
- "Greatness in cricket is judged by performances against the very best—and for Root, that’s still a challenge."

## GenAI Tools Used
- **Script Generation:** GPT-4 (OpenAI ChatGPT)
- **Voiceover:** ElevenLabs TTS or PlayHT
- **Video Creation:** Pika Labs, Runway, or CapCut (for vertical format, captions, and editing)
- **Optional:** Canva or CapCut for adding dynamic text and effects

## Explanation
I chose a vertical 9:16 format to match the style of Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, making it ideal for mobile and on-the-go viewing. The script starts with a strong hook, then quickly delivers key stats and insights, using captions for silent viewers. I used GPT-4 for concise scriptwriting, ElevenLabs for a natural-sounding voiceover, and CapCut for easy video assembly and captioning. The main challenge was condensing a detailed article into a 60-second engaging narrative. The result is a dynamic, accessible reel that’s perfect for busy sports fans.

## Bonus: Adaptations
- **Silent Consumption:** All key points are shown as on-screen captions.
- **For Commuters/Runners:** Brisk pacing, bold visuals, and large captions for easy viewing.
- **Multi-language:** Can generate Hindi/Hinglish captions/voiceover using the same tools.
- **Sport-specific Tone:** For cricket, used energetic and analytical language; for other sports, would adjust tone and style accordingly.
